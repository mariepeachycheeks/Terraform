☁️ AWS Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform
==========================================

This repository contains multiple AWS cloud infrastructure projects fully implemented using **Terraform**, created during the **WorldSkills Cloud Computing competition (Days 1 & 2)**.

Each project represents a real-world AWS solution built from business requirements, showcasing strong **DevOps**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and **cloud architecture** skills. The designs follow the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** for security, scalability, and cost efficiency.

*   Secure S3 access via VPC Endpoints
    

### ✅ 2. Cloud Migration & Consulting Scenarios

*   EC2-based web applications behind an ALB
    
*   IAM users, roles, and policies
    
*   Secure, scalable cloud architecture
    
*   Cost-optimized design principles
    

### ✅ 3. Serverless API

*   API Gateway + AWS Lambda (Python 3.10)
    
*   Highly available, cost-optimized endpoints
    
*   CloudWatch logging and monitoring
